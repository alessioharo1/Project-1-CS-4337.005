One thing I have learned from this first project is that I need to read directions more clearly and ahead of time. As it's evident, I have very little to no experience with GitHub, and reading the GitHub instructions ahead of time would have helped me be more proactive in finishing this project correctly. 

In my next change, I will be modifying the program to quit when the user types "quit" instead of just pressing enter.

Pre-fix calculator: I'm familiar with the post-fix expression, as I've learned about it in other classes. I refreshed myself, and it works by parsing the expression left to right. The two most right operands to the next operator are calculated with the corresponding operators and then the result is condensed in the expression. The expression will then continue to be condensed until only one remaining value remains. 

I've decided that instead of beginning to write the code in Racket, I'm going to write it first in a language I'm familiar with like Java. Due to the time constraint I put myself in, I will only write the pseudocode in Java, not the actual code. Then, in chunks I will write the pseudocode for my Racket program, and then in chunks again, I will write Racket program in chunks as well.
