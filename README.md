# Project-1-CS-4337.005

As this was my first major Racket program, I learned a lot of things. One of the first things I learned was how to work with vectors using `vector-length` and `vector-ref` to check for specific flags that determine whether the program should run in interactive or batch mode. I also learned more about cond, which allowed me to branch logic based on inputs.

Another concept I practiced was list processing. Most of the functions in my program operate on lists of characters, which forced me to practice using car, cdr, and null. As an example, skip-spaces used recursion by iterating through the list and removing leading whitespace. I also learned about type-checking functions such as char-numeric? and string->number, which determine whether a character represents a number and then converts it accordingly.

One of the biggest things I learned though, was error handling. I utilized `with-handlers` to catch errors, which I used for the first time in a project of this scale in Racket. 

My biggest takeaway from this project is Github. I wish I had spent much more time going through how to use GitHub, as I did all of my planning without it, and only read through how to use it very last minute. I had to go to office hours for help from the professor on how to even set it up, and I know it will take away a lot from my grade. For project 2, I will fully utilize GitHub from the start to learn how to develop in the real world, and also plan better for my project. 

Thank you for your time.
